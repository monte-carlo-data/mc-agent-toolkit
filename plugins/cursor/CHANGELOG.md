# Changelog

All notable changes to the Monte Carlo Agent Toolkit plugin for Cursor will be documented in this file.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.9.0] - 2026-04-27

### Changed

- Slim the prevent skill: delegate Workflow 1 (table health check) to `monte-carlo-asset-health` and Workflow 6 (add monitor) to `monte-carlo-monitoring-advisor`. Remove the alert-triage workflow entirely.
- Renumber the impact-assessment and validation-query workflows to W2 and W3. Workflow numbers 4 and 5 are reserved for sandbox-build and execute-validation steps from the in-flight `mc-validate run` work.
- Single-line `description` field in `skills/prevent/SKILL.md` per the ≤250-char authoring rule.
- Drop alert-mutation tools (`updateAlert`, `setAlertOwner`, `createOrUpdateAlertComment`) from the prevent skill's MCP tool table — those belong to the incident-response peer skill.

### Fixed

- Clear the `MC_MONITOR_GAP` cache marker after the post-edit / pre-commit prompt has been delivered, so subsequent prompts don't re-nag for the same gap (Python hooks and OpenCode TS hooks).

## [1.8.2] - 2026-04-23

### Changed

- `monitoring-advisor`: hardened the `create_*_monitor_mac` guidance against the top failure modes seen in production over the last 7 days (70 events across 14 categories). Changes span `data-monitor-creation.md` (domain-uuid resolution, warehouse-UUID requirement, column-verification gate, enum discipline, table existence check) and the per-type references (`alert_condition` shape constraints in `data-validation-monitor`, metric-name and operator-enum corrections in `data-metric-monitor` / `data-custom-sql-monitor`, `change`-threshold documentation in `data-custom-sql-monitor`, datetime-type requirement for `aggregate_time_field`, arg-shape constraints in `data-table-monitor` and `data-validation-monitor`, predicate/field-type semantics in `data-validation-monitor`, `threshold_value` requirement clarification in `data-comparison-monitor`). See [PR #66](https://github.com/monte-carlo-data/mc-agent-toolkit/pull/66) for the full error → fix mapping.

### Fixed

- `scripts/bump-version.sh` normalizes drifted plugin versions. Before this release, claude-code was at 1.8.1 while codex/copilot/cursor/opencode were stuck at 1.7.0 because the script's sed only matched the claude-code version. The non-monotonic 1.7.0 → 1.8.2 jump on those four plugins is intentional — they caught up to the canonical version in this PR. Future bumps stay in sync automatically.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-06

### Changed

- Restructure from per-skill `mc-prevent` plugin to unified `mc-agent-toolkit` plugin
- Plugin directory is now `plugins/cursor/` (was `plugins/cursor/prevent/`)
- Hooks namespaced under `hooks/prevent/` for multi-skill support
- Shared hook logic moved to `plugins/shared/prevent/lib/`

### Upgrade instructions

Existing users should re-run the install script to pick up the new structure:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/monte-carlo-data/mc-agent-toolkit/main/plugins/cursor/scripts/install.sh)
```

_History prior to the unified toolkit restructure (when this was the `mc-prevent` plugin):_

## [1.0.0-prevent] - 2026-04-02

### Added

- Initial Cursor adapter for Monte Carlo Prevent
- Hook-based enforcement for dbt model edits (pre-edit gate, post-edit accumulator, turn-end validation prompt, commit gate)
- `/mc-validate` command for explicit validation
- Monte Carlo MCP server wiring
- Shared platform-agnostic hook logic via `hooks/prevent/lib/`
