# Triage Stages

Each stage of a triage workflow is optional and customisable. Design your workflow around the stages that match how your team manually reviews alerts — automate the parts that are repetitive or time-consuming, and keep humans in the loop for the parts that need judgement.

---

## Stage 1: Fetching alerts

**Tool:** `get_alerts`

Collect the alerts you want to triage. `get_alerts` supports the following filters — combine them to define your triage scope:

**Status**
- `statuses` — filter by alert status. Pass `NOT_ACKNOWLEDGED` to only pick up alerts that haven't been triaged yet. Other values: `ACKNOWLEDGED`, `WORK_IN_PROGRESS`, `FIXED`, `EXPECTED`, `NO_ACTION_NEEDED`.

**Scope**
- `domain_ids` — limit to one or more Monte Carlo domains. Use `getDomains` to look up IDs. Useful if different teams own different parts of the data estate.
- `audience_ids`
- `owners`

**Alert Details**
- `alert_types` — filter by alert category.
- `priorities` — `P1` through `P5`.

**Asset**
- `table_mcons`, `table_names`, `table_schemas`, `table_databases` — narrow triage to specific tables or parts of the warehouse.

**Pagination**
- `first` — number of alerts per page (max 100, default 20). Check for a `truncation_note` in the response — if present, paginate using `cursor` to retrieve the remaining alerts.

Take care to avoid triaging too many alerts in one batch — where required, split alerts across multiple triage runs.

## Stage 2: Initial investigation (alert scoring)

**Tool:** `alert_assessment`

This stage replicates what a knowledgeable engineer does when scanning the alert feed — quickly assessing what's fired and how serious it looks. `alert_assessment` is lightweight enough to run on every alert.

It returns:
- **`alert_confidence`** (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) — how likely the alert represents a real issue. Affected by: number of events, presence of concerning root causes (query changes, failures), how much thresholds were exceeded, and how noisy the monitor typically is.
- **`alert_impact`** (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) — how significant the potential downstream impact is.  Use cases impacted.  Dashboards affected etc.
- A natural-language summary of the alert.

**Run `alert_assessment` in parallel**, in batches of up to 10 at a time.

### Customising the scoring

`alert_assessment` runs with a default prompt but accepts a `user_instructions` parameter that lets you adjust the emphasis it places on different factors. For example:

- Increase the weight given to monitors that feed particular use cases
- Alter the emphasis placed on different features: for example historical noise
- Emphasise alerts involving specific tables or domains

Start with the defaults and tune `user_instructions` once you've seen real output.

## Stage 3: Deep troubleshooting

**Tools:** `run_troubleshooting_agent`, `get_troubleshooting_agent_results`

`run_troubleshooting_agent` runs the Monte Carlo Troubleshooting Agent on a single alert. This is substantially more expensive than `alert_assessment` — it tracks the issue upstream through lineage, analyses all queries involved, examines relevant PRs, and samples affected tables to identify root cause.

**Only run `run_troubleshooting_agent` on alerts that warrant it.** A common filter: run troubleshooting only when BOTH `alert_confidence` AND `alert_impact` are MEDIUM or HIGH. Skip any alert where either is LOW.

You can adjust this threshold based on your environment — for example, also running troubleshooting when either score is HIGH (even if the other is LOW), while still requiring MEDIUM/MEDIUM as the baseline.

**Use async mode for parallelism.** `run_troubleshooting_agent` defaults to `async_mode=True`, returning immediately with one of three statuses:
- `success` — a previous analysis already completed; results are available immediately, no polling needed
- `queued` — the job was accepted but hasn't started yet; wait ~30 seconds then start polling
- `running` — the job is in progress; poll with increasing intervals (30s, 60s, 60s…)

Fire all eligible alerts simultaneously, then poll each with `get_troubleshooting_agent_results(incident_id=...)` until it returns `success` or `failed`. Classify each alert as its result arrives. This avoids the timeout issues of synchronous calls and removes the need to limit concurrency.

---

## Stage 4: Classification

Classify each alert immediately after its troubleshooting result arrives. Use the troubleshooting output to determine which category fits best.

| Classification              | Description                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------- |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Intentional change**      | Planned migrations, feature releases, or bug fixes                                                                             |
| **Natural data variation**  | Seasonal patterns or expected volatility                                                                                       |
| **Possible data incident**  | Anything that requires further investigation                                                                                   |
| **Resolved incident**       | A real incident that has already been resolved                                                                                 |
| **Verified ongoing incident** | A clear incident that has not resolved, where troubleshooting identified the root cause (e.g. query change or infrastructure failure) |
| **Other**                   | Does not fit the above                                                                                                         |

These categories are a starting point. Adapt them to the language your team uses — if you have an internal classification scheme, map to that instead.

## Stage 5: Taking actions

What you do after triage depends on your integrations, your team's workflow, and the maturity of your automation process. Start conservative and expand as you validate results.

### Adding comments

`create_or_update_alert_comment` — always a good starting point. Comments provide a record of what the agent found and recommended, without taking any irreversible action. Useful at every stage, regardless of whether you automate anything else.

Suggested comment content:
- **Scored but not troubleshot**: one sentence describing the anomaly and the confidence/impact scores. Do not explain why it wasn't troubleshot. No recommendations.
- **Troubleshot alerts**: 2–4 sentences — classification, reasoning, action taken or recommended

### Updating alert status

`update_alert` — set status based on classification:

| Classification              | Status               |
| --------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Natural data variation      | `NO_ACTION_NEEDED`   |
| Intentional change          | `EXPECTED`           |
| Resolved incident           | `FIXED`              |
| Verified ongoing incident   | `ACKNOWLEDGED`       |
| Possible data incident      | *(leave unchanged)*  |
| Other                       | *(leave unchanged)*  |

Only update status for alerts that went through full troubleshooting. Leave untroubleshot alerts unchanged.

### Additional Monte Carlo actions

- **Declare an incident** (`update_alert` with `declared_incident_severity`) — promotes the alert to an incident, escalating visibility. Values: `SEV_1`–`SEV_4`. Use `NO_SEVERITY` to clear. Appropriate for verified ongoing incidents.
- **Assign ownership** (`set_alert_owner`) — route a confirmed incident or required investigation to the right person.
- **Mark events as normal** — for alerts classified as natural variation, marking the underlying events as normal allows the detector to adapt thresholds to prevent further alerts on similar patterns. (Not yet available via MCP).

### External integrations

- **Slack** — message a channel or individual with a triage summary or escalation
- **Linear / Jira / Teams** — create a ticket for confirmed incidents

Introduce these actions incrementally. Start with comments, validate, then enable status updates and additional actions.
